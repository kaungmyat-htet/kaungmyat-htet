Hello! This is Kaung Myat Htet or just call me Ted.

I'm passionate about building AI solutions using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and large language models (LLMs) along with a focus on MLOps for scalable deployment.

I'm also aspiring to do research in areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, Data Mining and Recommendation Systems.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects.
You can find some of my contributions here:
